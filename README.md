# Analysis and Experiment in relation to recommender systems

This repository consists of 

- Python scripts in which functions for recommender system are implimented.
- Documents about implimentation and analysis of recommender systems.

## Disclaimer 

- I respect the reproducibility, however the result might be changed due to
  modification of scripts.
- At your own risk.
